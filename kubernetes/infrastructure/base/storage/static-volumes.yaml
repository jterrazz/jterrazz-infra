# Storage Configuration
#
# All apps use the K3s built-in local-path provisioner:
# - Dynamic provisioning (no pre-created PVs needed)
# - Data stored in: /var/lib/rancher/k3s/storage/
# - Automatic cleanup on PVC deletion
#
# To use in apps, set: storageClass: local-path
# The PVC will be automatically provisioned when the pod starts.

# Note: The "manual" StorageClass is kept for backward compatibility
# but should not be used for new deployments.
